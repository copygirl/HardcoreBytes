# Hardcore Bytes

This [Minecraft] (Java Edition) modpack aims to create a hardcore progression
and exploration focused modpack with *[OpenComputers]* as its goal. Meaning
you will struggle with wildy unfamiliar crafting recipes, explore abandoned
facilities, extracing resources and programs, eventually building an automated
base powered by computers.

## Development

*Hardcore Bytes* uses [Voodoo] for easy mod version management, downloading
the latest version of mods directly from CurseForge, providing self-updating
[MultiMC] instances and much more.

To get started, download the latest `bootstrap-voodoo.jar` from [Jenkins].
